# Itibarai Bot by NoDrops 🤖✨

This is a powerful automation tool designed to interact with the [RabitiAI Airdrop](https://beta.rabitiai.net/?ref=YNFHIF). It handles everything from daily check-ins to completing missions and exchanging points for POP, all managed through a sleek and informative command-line dashboard.

-----

### 🚀 Features

This bot is packed with features to make your participation in the RabitiAI airdrop as smooth as possible:

* **🏆 Automated Daily Check-in**: Automatically performs the daily check-in for all your accounts to maximize rewards.
* **📜 Automated Mission Completion**: Intelligently completes available missions while skipping specific types like on-chain or invite-related tasks.
* **✨ Automatic POP Exchange**: If enabled, the bot automatically exchanges 1000 points for 1 POP token whenever available.
* **👥 Multi-Account Support**: Manage and run tasks for multiple accounts seamlessly by adding private keys to your `.env` file.
* **📊 Comprehensive Dashboard**: A user-friendly and detailed command-line interface to monitor the status, points, POP balance, and logs for each account in real-time.
* **⚙️ Fully Configurable**: Easily enable or disable features like POP claiming and the daily cycle reset through the `config.js` file.
* **🔄 Daily Cycle Reset**: The bot can automatically restart its task cycle every day at a user-defined time.

### 🤔 How It Works?

The bot operates in a continuous, configurable cycle. Here’s a high-level overview of a single run:

1.  **Initialization**: The bot loads all wallets that generated by private keys from your `.env` file.
2.  **Account Processing**: For each account, the bot performs the following sequence of operations:
    * Logs into the RabitiAI platform and fetches your account data.
    * Performs the daily check-in.
    * Completes all available and eligible missions.
    * Checks if points can be exchanged for POP and proceeds if enabled in the config.
    * Logs the final points and status to `points.log`.
3.  **Cycle Reset**: Once all accounts are processed, the bot displays a final summary. If `CYCLE_RESET` is enabled, it will calculate the time until the next run (defined by `RESET_TIME`) and begin a countdown.

### 📋 Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)**: Version 14.x or higher.

### ⚠️ Security Warning

**Your private keys are your responsibility.** This script requires you to input your private keys into the `.env` file to function.

* **NEVER** share your `.env` file or your private keys with anyone.
* Review the code to understand how your keys are used. They are only used for creating wallet instances to get your address.
* It is recommended to use "burner" wallets that are funded only with the necessary assets.
